I am currently a Ph.D. student in the Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering at University of Washington. I am working with [Prof. Jenq-Neng Hwang](https://people.ece.uw.edu/hwang/) and  the [Information Prcoessing Lab](https://ipl-uw.github.io/). Go dawgs!

I received my M.S. degree in ECE at University of Washington. Prior to that, I received my B.S. degree in EE at National Taiwan University. I worked with [Prof. Yu-Chiang Frank Wang](http://vllab.ee.ntu.edu.tw/members.html) at the [Vision and Learning Lab](http://vllab.ee.ntu.edu.tw/) on computer vision. I also worked with [Prof. Lin-Shan Lee](http://speech.ee.ntu.edu.tw/previous_version/lslNew.htm) and [Prof. Hung-Yi Lee](https://speech.ee.ntu.edu.tw/~tlkagk/index.html) at the  [Speech Processing Lab](https://speech.ee.ntu.edu.tw/previous_version/index.htm) on natural language processing. I also TAed of [Machine Learning](https://speech.ee.ntu.edu.tw/~hylee/ml/2021-spring.html) (Spring 2018 & Autumn 2018) and [Deep Learning for Computer Vision](http://vllab.ee.ntu.edu.tw/dlcv.html) (Spring 2018).

My recent research interests lie around 3D human pose estimation and multi-modality deep learning.
